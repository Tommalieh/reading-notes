## HTML

### Text  

* When creating a web page, you add tags (known as markup) to the contents of the page. These tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure for the page.

* There are two types of markup
   1. Structural Markup: such as the elements used to describe headings and paragraphs.
   2. Semantic Markup: which provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the meaning of acronyms, and so on.

* HTML has six "levels" of headings: ![IMG]()

* `<h1>` is used for main headings, `<h2>` is used for subheadings, If there are further sections under the subheadings then the `<h3>` element is used, and so on...

* To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening `<p>` tag and closing `</p>` tag. And it's considered a block element.

* When the browser comes across two or more spaces next to each other, it only displays one space. Similarly if it comes across a line break, it treats that as a single space too. This is known as **white space collapsing**.

### Visual editors & Their code Views  

* Content management systems and HTML editors such as Dreamweaver usually have two views of the page you are creating: a visual editor and a code view.

* Visual editors often resemble word processors. Although each editor will differ slightly, there are some features that are common to most editors that allow you to control the presentation of text. ![IMG]()

* Code views show you the code created by the visual editor so you can manually edit it, or so you can just enter new code yourself. It is often activated using a button with an icon that says HTML or has angled brackets. White space may be added to the code by the editor to make the code easier to read.![IMG]()
