### Transforms

* Transform is a new CSS3 technique for an alternative ways to size, position, and change elements.

* The transform property comes in two different settings, **two-dimensional** and **three-dimensional**. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.

* Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes, known as **horizontal** and **vertical axes**.

* Three-dimensional transforms work on both the **x and y axes, as well as the z axis**. These three-dimensional transforms help define not only the length and width of an element, but also the **depth**.

* The transform property accepts a handful of different values. The **rotate** value provides the ability to rotate an element **from 0 to 360 degrees**. Using a **positive** value will rotate an element **clockwise**, and using a **negative value** will rotate the element **counterclockwise**. The **default point of rotation is the center of the element**, 50% 50%, both horizontally and vertically.

* Example:

```
  .box-1 {
  transform: rotate(20deg);
}
.box-2 {
  transform: rotate(-55deg);
}

```

* Using the **scale** value within the transform property allows you to **change the appeared size of an element**. The **default scale value is 1**, therefore any value between .99 and .01 makes an element appear smaller while any value greater than or equal to 1.01 makes an element appear larger.

* With CSS3 transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.

* There are four transition related properties in total, including **transition-property**, **transition-duration**, **transition-timing-function**, and **transition-delay**. Not all of these are required to build a transition, with the first three are the most popular.

* The transition-property property determines exactly what properties will be altered in conjunction with the other transitional properties. By default, all of the properties within an elementâ€™s different states will be altered upon change. However, only the properties identified within the transition-property value will be affected by any transitions.

* The transition-timing-function property is used to set the speed in which a transition will move. Knowing the duration from the transition-duration property a transition can have multiple speeds within a single duration. A few of the more popular keyword values for the transition-timing-function property include linear, ease-in, ease-out, and ease-in-out.

* To set multiple points at which an element should undergo a transition, use the @keyframes rule. The @keyframes rule includes the animation name, any animation breakpoints, and the properties intended to be animated.
