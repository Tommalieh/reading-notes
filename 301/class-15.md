## Diversity And Inclusion

* It is clear that the advertising narrative around women and technology needs to be more inclusive if the gender gap is going to close. Until that happens, as Ames argues, advertising will continue to drive “a subtle message to girls and women that it’s not a place where they belong.”

* Diversity efforts are most successful when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders. And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters.

### Diverse Teams Are Smarter And More Creative 

* Diversity offers significant benefits for teams focused on creativity and innovation. According to Scott E. Page, professor of complex systems, political science and economics at the University of Michigan: "Diverse groups of people bring to organizations more and different ways of seeing a problem and, thus, faster/better ways of solving it."


* At Intel, CEO Brian Krzanich has said: "A fully diverse and inclusive workplace is fundamental to our ability to innovate and deliver business results." 

### Diverse Companies Perform Better

* Racial diversity was clearly tied to better financial performance. Research also links gender representation at the executive and board level with better company performance. 

* Anecdotes of companies that have succeeded in spite of homogeneity are not a counterpoint to the overwhelming evidence that diversity makes teams smarter and is linked to positive business outcomes.  

### Companies Are Losing Out on Great Talent

* Failing to attract and hire employees from underrepresented backgrounds leads companies to miss out on incredible talent.

### Diverse Companies Can Better Serve a Diverse User Base 

* When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups.

### It’s The Right Thing to Do 

* Tech industry is creating vast opportunity and that by excluding certain groups from that opportunity the industry is perpetuating and exacerbating existing social inequality.

* Failing to involve particular communities in the process of creating of new technology, we as a society lose out on the benefits of those community members’ ideas. 

* Leaders must create a strategy for building a more diverse, inclusive company and an accountability plan to ensure that strategy is effective.
