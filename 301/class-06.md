## Node.js

### What's Node.js?!

* Node.js is a JavaScript **runtime** built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine. And it is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses libuv library.

* The **V8 engine** is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for **compiling** JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.

* That's doesn’t mean that Node programs are executed in a browser. They aren’t. Rather, the creator of Node (Ryan Dahl) took the V8 engine and enhanced it with various features, such as a file system API, an HTTP library, and a number of operating system–related utility methods. This means that Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime.

* **NPM**, is a package manager that comes bundled with Node. In addition to being the package manager for JavaScript, npm is also the world’s largest software registry. 

* Node has excellent support for ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and beyond. As you’re only targeting one runtime (a specific version of the V8 engine), this means that you can write your JavaScript using the latest and most modern syntax. It also means that you don’t generally have to worry about compatibility issues.

* One of the biggest use cases for Node.js — running JavaScript on the server.
