## Event Queue:
In general An **event queue** is a repository where events from an application are held prior to being processed by a receiving program or system.
In **Node js**  Node thread keeps an event loop and whenever a task gets completed, it fires the corresponding event which signals the event-listener function to execute.

### OSI Model:
**The Open Systems Interconnection** or **(OSI)** model is a conceptual model provides a standard for different computer systems to be able to communicate with each other.
- The model partitions a communication system into abstraction layers.
- A layer serves the layer above it and is served by the layer below it.
- The model is a product of the Open Systems Interconnection project at the **International Organization for Standardization (ISO)**.

### The Internet protocol suite:
**The Internet protocol suite**  is the conceptual model and set of communications protocols used in the Internet and similar computer networks.
- the foundational protocols in the suite are the **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)** and the **Internet Protocol (IP)** so that is called **TCP/IP** too. 
- **The Internet protocol suite** provides end-to-end data communication specifying how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received


#### The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) Header:
- **The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) header**is the first 24 bytes of a TCP segment that contains the parameters and state of an end-to-end TCP socket.
- The TCP header is used to track the state of communication between two TCP endpoints.

### Connection Establishment
A connection is typically used for client-server interaction. A server advertizes a particular server at a well-known address and clients establish connections to that socket to avail of the offered service.
