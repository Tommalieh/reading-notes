# ExpoKit

  - ExpoKit is an Objective-C and Java library that allows you to use the Expo platform and your existing Expo project 
    as part of a larger standard native project -- one that you would normally create using Xcode, Android Studio, or react-native init.


    1. Install Expo CLI.
    2. Make sure you have the necessary configuration options in app.json. 
    3. Eject.
    4. Set up and Run your native project.
    5. Make native changes.
    6. Distribute your app.


# React Native 

   - React Native is like React, but it uses native components instead of web components as building blocks.  

   - React Native lets you create truly native apps and doesn't compromise your users' experiences. It provides a core 
     set of platform agnostic native components like View, Text, and Image that map directly to the platform’s native UI building blocks.

   - React components wrap existing native code and interact with native APIs via React’s declarative UI paradigm and 
     JavaScript.
