## HTML

### Images

* A picture can say a thousand words, and great images help make the difference between an average-looking site and a really engaging one.

* There are many reasons why you might want to add an image to a web page: you might want to include a logo, photograph, illustration, diagram, or chart.

* When adding an image to the website it's good to keep in mind the following:
  * Is it relevant?!
  * Does it convey helpful information?!
  * Is it fit for the mood the website is creating?!
  * Will your audience be able to recognize it on the go?!
  * Does it fit the color pallet and the general theme of the website?!

* To add an image into the page you need to use an `<img>` element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the following attribute:
  * `src = "source-link"`: tells the browser where it can find the image file. This will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your own site.

* There are three rules to remember when you are creating images for your website:
  1. Save Images In the right format: Websites mainly use images in **jpeg**, **gif**, or **png** format. *If you choose the wrong image format* then your image might not look as sharp as it should and can make the web page slower to load.
  
  2. Save images at the right size:  If the image is **smaller** than the **width or height** that you have **specified** for the website, the image can be **distorted** and **stretched**. On the other hand If the image is **larger** than the **width** and **height** you have specified, the image **will take longer** time to display on the page.

  3. Use the correct resolution: Saving images at a **higher resolution** results in images that are **larger** than necessary and take **longer to download**.

* When cropping images it is *important not to lose valuable information*. It is best to source images that are the correct shape if possible.


### Color

* Color can really bring the web-page to life.

* It's possible to change the color of so many instance of the web-page using CSS properties, such as `color: value;` to change the text color and `background-color: value;` to change the background color.

* You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:

  1. RGB Values: These express colors in terms of how much **red**, **green** and **blue** are used to make it. For example: `rgb(100,100,90)`

  2. Hex Codes: These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign. For example: `#ee3e80`

  3. Color Names: There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. For example: `DarkCyan`

* CSS3 introduces an entirely new and intuitive way to specify colors using **hue**, **saturation**, **alpha** and **lightness** values. `hsla(value1, value2, value3, value4);`
  
  * Hue: hue is often represented as a color circle where the angle represents the color, expressed as an angle (between 0 and 360 degrees).

  * Saturation: the amount of gray in a color. Saturation is represented as a percentage. 100% is full saturation and 0% is a shade of gray.

  * Lightness: Lightness is the amount of white  (lightness) or black (darkness) in a color. Lightness is represented as a percentage. 0% lightness is black, 100% lightness is white, and 50% lightness is normal.

  * Alpha: This is expressed as a number between 0 and 1.0. For example, 0.5 represents 50% transparency, and 0.75 represents 75% transparency.


  ### Text

  * There are properties to control the choice of font, size weight, style, and spacing.

  * There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume most people will have installed.


  * If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are several options, but you need to have the right license to use them.

  * You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be indented.

  * You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or when they have visited a link.
